1) The TS Type System
- Helps us catch errors during development
- Uses 'type annotations' to analyse our code
- Only active during development
- Does't provide any performance optimization

TS Execution Flow
TypeScript Code -> TypeScript Compiler -> Plain Old JS

Summary:
- Writing TypeScript is the same as writing     JavaScript with some 'extra documentation'

- TypeScript has no effect on how our code get executed by the browser or Node

- It is best to think TypeScript as being like a friend setting behind you while you are coding
